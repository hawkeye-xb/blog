About me.

I have several years of application development experience. I've worked on web pages, developed apps (mobile, desktop), written services, tuned AI (Openai API), and much more.

I've had some exposure to various languages and platforms, and have some experience with SaaS, cloud, and privatization. I mainly believe that technology should serve needs, and what's suitable is the best.

Whether you're looking for best practices in application implementation, technical solutions, tool development, or even just a chat, feel free to contact me (hawkeyexb.helper@gmail.com) if there's anything I can help with.
